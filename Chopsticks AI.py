#HOW TO WIN: Get the player to have a 2/0, and the AI to have a 2/1. Then hit their 2 with your 2, they hit your 2 with a 1, then finally hit their 1 with your 3.

#HOW TO WIN AGAINST PLAYERS AND THE AI: Get yourself to 4/1, and the other person to 3/0. Then combine into 3/2. The bot will combine, but from there, you should just win.

#HOW TO PLAY:
#The first question during your turn is "What do you want to hit?"
#The second question, if you answered hand1 or hand2, is "With what hand?"
#If you answered 'combine' for the first question, then the second question is, "After the combination, what will be the bigger hand?"
#If you answered 'combine' for the first question, then the third question is, "How many fingers do you want to move to the bigger hand?"

#How to code:
#p_hand1 is the player's right hand
#p_hand2 is the player's left hand
#AI_hand1 is the AI's left hand
#AI_hand2 is the AI's right hand
#The variables:
#   p_big_hand
#   p_subtract_x_from_the_lesser_hand
#only do anything if the player wants to combine.
#For the Huge amount of code that the AI has, I count like this...  1, 2, 3, 4, 0, stop. But that doesn't make sense. It's just how I count in this program
